OOP offers several benefits to both the program designer and the
user. The principal advantages are.
* Emphasis is on _structure of the model/system_ rather than procedure (e.g. what needs to be done).
* Programs are divided into what are known as _objects/classes_. These 
are divided into _actors, services and data_. 

* Functions that operate on the data of an object are _tied together_
in within the class.
* Some data and functions are _hidden and cannot be accessed_ by external functions.
* Objects may communicate with each other through functions.
* Through interfaces and abstract classes, we can specify _contracts the other classes must fulfill_ in order 
  to be allowed to interact with us 
* We can build program from working and tested modules rather than having to start
writing the code from scratch. 
* We can specify a _guarantee_ that our  code is correct, and supply it with a range of tests to constantly check
  if the guarantee still holds. 
* It is easier to partition the work in a project, based on objects.
* Object-oriented systems can be easily upgraded from small to
large systems.
* Message passing techniques for communication between
objects makes the interface description with external systems
much simpler. This can be further extended to message passing between running
  programs (e.g. via networks or OS-mechanisms)
* Software complexity can be easily managed.
